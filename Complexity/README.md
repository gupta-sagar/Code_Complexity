# Complexity

We will be implementing simple algorithms for checking basic properties of code complexity.

### Esprima

We will use an existing library, [esprima](http://esprima.org/), to parse code and create a static analyzer for basic code complexity metrics.

### Interactive AST

Use the [demo page](http://esprima.org/demo/parse.html) to see what a code snippet looks like, in order to help you navigate the data structure.
